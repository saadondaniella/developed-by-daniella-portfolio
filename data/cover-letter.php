        "Hi! I’m Daniella, a web development student with a strong interest in the intersection between design and technology. After making a deliberate career change, I’ve found a field where I genuinely enjoy both the learning process and the work itself.",

        "I would describe myself as a driven, positive and detail-oriented person who values doing things properly. I enjoy working in environments where quality matters, and where collaboration and communication are an important part of the process. In teams, I tend to adapt to the situation — sometimes taking responsibility, sometimes supporting others — always with the goal of creating a good flow and a thoughtful result.",

        "When I encounter something I don’t yet know, I see it as an opportunity rather than a setback. I enjoy learning step by step, combining theory with hands-on practice, and I’m motivated by problem-solving and building things that actually work. I’m especially drawn to work where structure and logic meet visual details and user experience",

        "Looking ahead, I'm excited to keep learning and growing at a steady pace, together with others. I enjoy being in environments where design and development naturally come together, and where there's room to build things thoughtfully rather than rushing to quick fixes.",

        "I’m looking forward to continuing my journey, learning more over time, and becoming increasingly confident in my role — while staying curious, grounded and committed to doing meaningful work."
